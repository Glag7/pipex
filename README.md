# From the subject :

__Summary:__  
This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you already know
by using it in your program.  
Version: 3  

Your program will be executed as follows:  
`./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2`  
It must behave exactly the same as the shell command below:  
`$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2`  

__bonuses :__  
• Handle multiple pipes.  
• Support « and » when the first parameter is "here\_doc".  

# Usage
`make` or `make bonus` for full version
